# Project Summary

I wanted to create Swedish Alphabets tracing app for kids so that they can able to learn alphanets easily. 
I created all the letters using buttons for all the Alphabets.
User can select any letter and trace it by finger or using mouse.
After the alphabet has been traced by 100 pixels user get appreciation message.
With appreciation message user can able to see image which starts with the letter, user has traced. 
I added the youtube video for alphabtets sound to make it more useful for kids.
